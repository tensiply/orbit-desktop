/**
 * Accented characters typed through an input method, delivered exactly once.
 *
 * On Linux, WebKitGTK routes keys through the input method (IBus on GNOME).
 * Any key the IM turns into a non-ASCII character — every á, é, í, ó, ú, ñ on
 * a Spanish layout — arrives as a keydown with keyCode 229, an input event
 * carrying the character, and a compositionend. There is no compositionstart.
 * Plain ASCII letters take the ordinary keydown path; only the accented ones
 * take this one.
 *
 * xterm.js handles that badly twice over. Its keydown handler reads the
 * character back out of its hidden textarea a tick later and sends it. Its
 * compositionend handler sends it again, slicing the textarea from a start
 * position that only compositionstart sets — so the position is stale — and
 * the textarea is never cleared, because nothing but Enter and Ctrl+C clear
 * it. Typing é, á, ő produced "é", "á" "á", "ő" "áő": doubled, then tripled,
 * then whatever had piled up in the textarea.
 *
 * So such a commit is taken over here. The character is sent from the input
 * event's own data, the textarea is emptied so xterm's delayed read finds no
 * change, and the orphaned compositionend that follows is kept from reaching
 * xterm. A commit this does not recognise is not touched at all. A real
 * composition — a dead key, where compositionstart does fire — is left
 * entirely to xterm, which handles it correctly.
 *
 * The listeners sit on the container in the capture phase, so they run before
 * xterm's own listeners on the textarea.
